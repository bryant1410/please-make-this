## A Better Mac Photo Viewer

##### Description:

In windows when you view a photo and click right it automatically shows the next photo in the folder. But in Mac you have to select all of the photos you want to view and open them to view them. 
So I want a Mac Photo Viewer where I don't have to select all of the photos in a folder to view them.

## Baloon Like Water Bottle

##### Description: 

We all carry water bottles in our back pack. Normal water bottles fill up the same space whether or not they are full or empty.
This is why I want a water bottle which is like a baloon, which can shrink into the size accordingly to the amount of water inside. The bottle must be reuseable, resisstant, flexible and easy to clean or better self cleaning.
